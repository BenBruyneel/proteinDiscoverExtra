# proteinDiscoverExtra

Examples functions that use the [proteinDiscover](https://github.com/BenBruyneel/proteinDiscover/) package.

For examples, see: [proteinDiscoverExtra](https://benbruyneel.github.io/proteinDiscover/extra/)

Update: adjustments to code due to changes in [proteinDiscover](https://github.com/BenBruyneel/proteinDiscover/). The examples 'manual' has also been updated to incorporate the changes. Also changes in [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) caused some example code to not run anymore.

Work in Progress!
